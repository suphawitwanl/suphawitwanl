**Hey there! 👋 I'm an AI and data science enthusiast**

I'm passionate about using AI and machine learning to solve real-world problems. I have experience in object detection, data prediction, computer vision, data preparation, and data analysis. I'm always up for a challenge and I'm excited to learn new things.

**What I know:**

* Python, SQL
* pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLOv8, Roboflow
* Google Cloud
* Tableau, Power BI

**What I've been up to:**

* **Built a chicken thigh detector with YOLOv8 (2023)**
    * It can find chicken thighs in real-time, like magic! 🐓
    * I even trained it to run on a robot. 🤖
* **Predicted Bitcoin prices with machine learning (2023)**
    * Used cool algorithms to guess how Bitcoin will move (don't tell Wall Street 😉).
* **Analyzed financial data like a boss (2023)**
    * Figured out the best way to buy Bitcoin over time (DCA FTW!).
    * Made fancy charts to visualize everything. 📈

I'm always down to connect with other data science enthusiasts!

**P.S.** I'm still a student at Bangkok University, but I'm eager to learn and grow. If you have any opportunities, hit me up!
